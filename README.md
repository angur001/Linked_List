## Linked_List
A VERY SIMPLE LINKED LIST IMPLEMENTATION IN C

## HOW TO USE 
you can copy the linked list source and header file to your project and use them as you wish. You can also try to run the included test by running 
```console
$ make
``` 
if you can't use make try this instead:
```console 
$ gcc -Wall -g linkedList.c testList.c && ./a
```
ENJOY!!
